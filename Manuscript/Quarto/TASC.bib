	abstract = {We show that certain extended dissipative dynamical systems naturally evolve into a critical state, with no characteristic time or length scales. The temporal ‘‘fingerprint’’ of the self-organized critical state is the presence of flicker noise or 1/f noise; its spatial signature is the emergence of scale-invariant (fractal) structure.},

	abstract = {We study a general Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld–type automaton model of self-organized criticality in which the toppling conditions depend on local height, but not on its gradient. We characterize the critical state, and determine its entropy for an arbitrary finite lattice in any dimension. The two-point correlation function is shown to satisfy a linear equation. The spectrum of relaxation times describing the approach to the critical state is also determined exactly.},
